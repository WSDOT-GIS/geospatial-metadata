01/01/1996 - Marci Carte
The source file was digitized from 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles using Intergraph's Microstation software. The Microstation DGN file was converted to an Arc/Info coverage with the Arc command "IGDSARC" and transformed to geographic coordinates with Arc commands "PROJECTDEFINE" and "PROJECT." Attributes were added to the linework and routes were created with the "ARCSECTION" command based on Accumulated Route Mileage.
10/01/2000 - Thomas A. Blake
The route and section tables were deleted from a copy of the existing state route files. Graphic and attribute updating were done using Desktop ArcInfo 8's ArcMap with WSDOT 7.5 minute quads for reference. New routes were created using aml's in ArcInfo.
11/28/2003 - Jordyn Mitchell
Existing lines from the previous LRS (Washington State Highways, 2000) were realigned to match orthoimagery. Three columns were added to the table of attributes. They are: Display, Rt_typeA, &amp; Rt_typeB. A .dbf file containing values to be used was joined and the attribute values for the new columns were calculated. Routes were calculated while the coverage was in Washington State Plane South NAD 83 coordinate system. The coverage was then projected into Geographic NAD83.
12/01/2004 - Heather Spates
Updates to the ramps and portions of the mainlines were completed in a geodatabase. Polylines were then broken out by direction and built into routes when the geodatabase was in Washington State Plane South NAD 83 coordinate system. The routes were then projected into Geographic NAD83. Frontage Roads and Local access roads were included in this edition.
01/16/2006 - Heather Spates
Ferry Terminals located in the TRIPS system and selected Proposed routes( found both in TRIPS and other records) are included in this edition. Ferry terminals were located via orthophotos or the end of cartographically drawn ferry routes. Proposed route linework are compiled from paper contract sheets.
07/24/2006 - Jordyn Mitchell
Four new attributes were added with the 2005B update. SRID, RID, RRT, RRQ. These were added to enable easier sorting and selecting of records. These were derived from the SR field.
05/21/2008 - Julie Fogde
The 2007 LRS is an update of the 2006 LRS. A copy of the Lines file of the 2006 LRS was updated using the 2007 Highway Log, GPS LRS, orthophotos, highway contract plans, and WSDOT project websites. Polylines were then broken out by direction and built into routes.
06/03/2009 - Derek Drake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2008 Washington State Road Log.
05/25/2010 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2009 Washington State Road Log. A new attribute LRS Date was added to indicate the valid date of the measures (ARMs) used to update the data set.
03/31/2011 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2010 Washington State Road Log.
11/15/2011 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the Washington State Highway Log as of 9/30/2011.
04/15/2012 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2011 Washington State Road Log.
03/15/2013 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2012 Washington State Road Log.
04/5/2014 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2013 Washington State Road Log.
04/1/2015 - Thomas A. Blake
The LRS data was edited to reflect changes in the state highway system according to the 2014 Washington State Road Log.
